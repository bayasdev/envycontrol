## Introduction ‚ÑπÔ∏è

EnvyControl is a program aimed to provide an easy way to switch GPU modes on Nvidia Optimus systems (i.e laptops with Intel + Nvidia or AMD + Nvidia configurations) under Linux.

### Compatible distros üêß

**This program was originally developed for Arch Linux** but it should work on any other Linux distribution.

On Debian and Ubuntu derivates the initramfs is rebuilt automatically after switching modes.

### Compatible display managers üñ•

- GDM
- SDDM
- LightDM

Other display managers might require manual configuration.

### Supported graphics modes üñº

- integrated
- nvidia
- hybrid

Read a detailed explanation [here](https://github.com/geminis3/envycontrol/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions#graphics-modes-explained).

### Tested devices üíª

- Acer Predator Helios 300 2017 (G3-571)
    - CPU: Intel Core i7-7700HQ
    - iGPU: Intel HD630
    - dGPU: Nvidia GTX 1060
    - OS: Arch Linux with Gnome

### A note on AMD + Nvidia systems ‚ö†Ô∏è

I don't own any device with this particular hardware combination (in theory `integrated` and `hybrid` modes should work), please contact me if you do.

## Get EnvyControl ‚¨áÔ∏è

Install the [envycontrol](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/envycontrol/) package with the AUR helper of your choice. If not on Arch Linux you can run `envycontrol.py` from source.

## Usage üìñ

```
usage: envycontrol.py [-h] [--status] [--switch MODE] [--dm DISPLAY_MANAGER] [--version]

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --status              Query the current graphics mode set by EnvyControl
  --switch MODE         Switch the graphics mode. You need to reboot for changes to apply. Supported modes: integrated, nvidia, hybrid
  --dm DISPLAY_MANAGER  Manually specify your Display Manager. This is required only for systems without systemd. Supported DMs: gdm, sddm, lightdm
  --version, -v         Print the current version and exit
```

### Examples üöÄ

Set graphics mode to `integrated` (disable the Nvidia GPU):

```
sudo envycontrol --switch integrated
```

Set graphics mode to `nvidia` (automatic display manager detection):

```
sudo envycontrol --switch nvidia
```

Manually specify your display manager for `nvidia` mode (useful for non-systemd users):

```
sudo envycontrol --switch nvidia --dm sddm
```

Show the current graphics mode:

```
envycontrol --status
```
