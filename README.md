# üëÅ‚Äçüó® EnvyControl

EnvyControl is a CLI tool that provides an easy way to switch between GPU modes on Nvidia Optimus systems (i.e laptops with hybrid Intel + Nvidia or AMD + Nvidia graphics configurations) under Linux.

### üìñ License

EnvyControl is free and open-source software released under the [MIT](https://github.com/bayasdev/envycontrol/blob/main/LICENSE) license.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

**This software is provided 'as-is' without any express or implied warranty.**

Keep in mind any custom X.org configuration may get deleted or overwritten when switching modes.

## ‚ú® Features

- üêç Written in Python 3+ for portability and compatibility
- üêß Works across all major Linux distros ([tested distros](https://github.com/bayasdev/envycontrol/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions#tested-distros))
- üñ•Ô∏è Supports GDM, SDDM and LightDM display managers ([manual setup instructions](https://github.com/bayasdev/envycontrol/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions#what-to-do-if-my-display-manager-is-not-supported) also available)
- üîã Save battery with integrated graphics mode
- üíª PCI-Express Runtime D3 (RTD3) Power Management support for Turing and later
- üéÆ Coolbits support for GPU overclocking
- üî• Fix screen tearing with ForceCompositionPipeline

## üìñ Graphics modes

### Integrated

- The integrated Intel or AMD iGPU is used exclusively
- Nvidia dGPU is turned off to reduce power consumption
- External screens cannot be used if the video ports are wired to the dGPU

### Hybrid

- Enables PRIME render offloading
- RTD3 allows the dGPU to be dynamically turned off when not in use
  - Available choices for the `--rtd3` flag (based on the [official documentation](http://us.download.nvidia.com/XFree86/Linux-x86_64/530.30.02/README/dynamicpowermanagement.html))
    - `0` disabled
    - `1` coarse-grained
    - `2` fine-grained (default value if you don't provide one)
    - `3` fine-grained for Ampere and later
  - Only works in Turing and later
- Performance on external screens might be reduced

### Nvidia

- The Nvidia dGPU is used exclusively
- Higher graphical performance and higher power consumption
- Recommended when working with external screens
  - If facing screen tearing enable ForceCompositionPipeline with the `--force-comp` flag
- Allows overlocking (not recommended) with the `--coolbits` flag
  - The default value is `28` bits however it can be manually adjusted according to this [guide](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/NVIDIA/Tips_and_tricks#Overclocking_and_cooling)
- Wayland sessions default to hybrid mode

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Usage

```
usage: envycontrol.py [-h] [-v] [-q] [-s MODE] [--dm DISPLAY_MANAGER] [--force-comp] [--coolbits [VALUE]] [--rtd3 [VALUE]] [--reset-sddm] [--reset] [--verbose]

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -v, --version         Output the current version
  -q, --query           Query the current graphics mode
  -s MODE, --switch MODE
                        Switch the graphics mode. Available choices: integrated, hybrid, nvidia
  --dm DISPLAY_MANAGER  Manually specify your Display Manager for Nvidia mode. Available choices: gdm, gdm3, sddm, lightdm
  --force-comp          Enable ForceCompositionPipeline on Nvidia mode
  --coolbits [VALUE]    Enable Coolbits on Nvidia mode. Default if specified: 28
  --rtd3 [VALUE]        Setup PCI-Express Runtime D3 (RTD3) Power Management on Hybrid mode. Available choices: 0, 1, 2, 3. Default if specified: 2
  --reset-sddm          Restore default Xsetup file
  --reset               Revert changes made by EnvyControl
  --verbose             Enable verbose mode
```

### Some examples

Set graphics mode to integrated:

```
sudo envycontrol -s integrated
```

Set graphics mode to hybrid and enable fine-grained power control:

```
sudo envycontrol -s hybrid --rtd3
```

Set graphics mode to nvidia, enable ForceCompositionPipeline and Coolbits with a value of 24:

```
sudo envycontrol -s nvidia --force-comp --coolbits 24
```

Set current graphics mode to nvidia and specify to setup LightDM display manager

```
sudo envycontrol -s nvidia --dm lightdm
```

Query the current graphics mode:

```
envycontrol --query
```

Revert all changes made by EnvyControl:

```
sudo envycontrol --reset
```

## ‚¨áÔ∏è Getting EnvyControl

### Arch Linux ([AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/envycontrol))

1. `yay -S envycontrol`
2. Run `sudo envycontrol -s <MODE>` to switch graphics modes

### Fedora

Use the [COPR](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/sunwire/envycontrol/) maintained by [@sunwire](https://github.com/sunwire)

1. Enable the repository with `sudo dnf copr enable sunwire/envycontrol`
2. `sudo dnf install python3-envycontrol`
3. Run `sudo envycontrol -s <MODE>` to switch graphics modes

### Ubuntu / Debian

Since [PEP668 adoption](https://www.linuxuprising.com/2023/03/next-debianubuntu-releases-will-likely.html) is no longer possible to install pip packages outside a virtual environment, instead use the provided deb package:

1. Go to the [latest release page](https://github.com/bayasdev/envycontrol/releases/latest)
2. Download the attached `python3-envycontrol_version.deb` package
2. Install it with `sudo apt -y install ./python3-envycontrol_version.deb`
3. Run `sudo envycontrol -s <MODE>` to switch graphics modes

### From source

1. Clone this repository with `git clone https://github.com/bayasdev/envycontrol.git` or download the latest tarball from the releases page
2. Run the script from the root of the repository like this `python ./envycontrol.py -s <MODE>`

üí° Replace `python` with `python3` on Ubuntu/Debian

### Install globally as a pip package

- From the root of the cloned repository run `sudo pip install .`
- Now you can run `sudo envycontrol -s <MODE>` from any directory to switch graphics modes.

## üëï GUIs

### Gnome Extension

The [GPU profile selector](https://github.com/LorenzoMorelli/GPU_profile_selector) extension provides a simple way to switch between graphics modes in a few clicks, you can get it from [here](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/5009/gpu-profile-selector/).

**Make sure to have EnvyControl installed globally!**

### KDE Widget

[Optimus GPU Switcher](https://github.com/enielrodriguez/optimus-gpu-switcher) allows you to change the GPU mode easily, plus its icon is dynamic and serves as an indicator of the current mode.

## üí° Tips

### Wayland session is missing on Gnome 43+

GDM now requires `NVreg_PreserveVideoMemoryAllocations` kernel parameter which breaks sleep in nvidia and hybrid mode, as well as rtd3 in hybrid mode, so EnvyControl disables it, if you need a Wayland session follow the instructions below

```
sudo systemctl enable nvidia-{suspend,resume,hibernate}
sudo ln -s /dev/null /etc/udev/rules.d/61-gdm.rules
```

### The `/usr/share/sddm/scripts/Xsetup` file is missing on my system

If this ever happens please run `sudo envycontrol --reset-sddm`.
